## Introduction

A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM(BYOL/PAYG) on Azure

## Requirements

## Deployment overview

Terraform deploys the following components:

* Two firewall rules: one for external, one for internal.

## Deployment

To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:

1. Clone the repository.
1. Customize variables in the `variables.tf` file as needed.

1. Initialize the providers and modules:

   ```sh
   cd XXXXX
   terraform init
   ```

1. Submit the Terraform plan:

   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

1. Verify output.

1. Confirm and apply the plan:

   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

1. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
